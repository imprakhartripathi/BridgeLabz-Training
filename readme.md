### 📅 **19 Dec — Refactoring & Control Flow Expansion**

- Refactored Level 1 files to ensure:
  - Correct **class–file name alignment**
  - Cleaner structure and consistency
- Added **Control Flow problems** across multiple levels

📂 Reference:
- [`control-flow`](https://github.com/imprakhartripathi/BridgeLabz-Training/tree/core-java-practice/gcr-codebase/control-flow) ↗️  
  Includes:
  - Conditional logic (Even/Odd, Leap Year, Voting Eligibility)
  - Iterative logic (Factorial, Multiplication Table, FizzBuzz)
  - Number-based problems (Prime, Armstrong, Harshad)

---

### 📅 **20 Dec — Scenario-Based Programs & Refined I/O**

- Implemented scenario-based exercises to practice I/O, control flow, and basic arithmetic:
  - `MayaBMIFitnessTracker.java` — Interactive BMI tracker: prompts for weight and height, computes BMI using `weight / (height * height)`, and prints category (Underweight / Normal / Overweight).
  - `TheCoffeeCounterChronicles.java` — Cafe billing simulator: accepts coffee type and quantity, computes bill, applies 18% GST, and supports `exit` to quit the loop.
- Files added under the `scenario-based` folder with clear, self-explanatory class names and concise user prompts.
